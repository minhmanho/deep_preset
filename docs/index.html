				<h2>Abstract</h2>
				<br>
				End-users, without knowledge in photography, desire to beautify their photos to have a similar color style 
				as a well-retouched reference.
				However, recent works in image style transfer are overused. They usually synthesize undesirable results due 
				to transferring exact colors to the wrong destination.
				It becomes even worse in sensitive cases such as portraits.
				In this work, we concentrate on learning low-level image transformation, especially color-shifting methods, 
				rather than mixing contextual features, then present a novel scheme to train color style transfer with ground-truth.
				Furthermore, we propose a color style transfer named Deep Preset.
				It is designed to 1) generalize the features representing the color transformation from content with natural 
				colors to retouched reference, then blend it into the contextual features of content, 2) predict hyper-parameters 
				(settings or preset) of the applied low-level color transformation methods, 3) stylize content to have a similar 
				color style as reference. We script Lightroom, a powerful tool in editing photos, to generate 600,000 training 
				samples using 1,200 images from the Flick2K dataset and 500 user-generated presets with 69 settings. Experimental 
				results show that our Deep Preset outperforms the previous works in color style transfer quantitatively and qualitatively.
